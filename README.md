In this assignment, I delved into the fundamental concepts of descriptive statistics using Python. 

**Topics Covered** in this assigments are :

**Basic Descriptive Statistics**: Covers measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and graphical 
representations like density plots and cumulative frequency distributions.
**Analysis of Distributions:** Interprets distributions using mean, median, skewness, and visual representations like density curves.
**Inferential Statistics:** Calculates z-scores to determine data points' positions within distributions.
**Data Handling and Imputation:** Handles missing values and imputes logical values, as seen in the 'Mortgage' variable.
**Relationship Analysis: Examines** relationships between variables, utilizing methods like scatter plots.
**Outlier Detection:** Identifies outliers and suggests suitable visualization methods for stakeholder communication.

**Approach Taken:**

**Understanding the Problem:** Each question in the assignment was carefully examined to grasp the statistical concept being tested and the specific data manipulation required.
**Data Preparation:** Before performing any analysis, the dataset was loaded into Python, and necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and data transformation were performed.
**Statistical Analysis:** Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, appropriate statistical measures were computed for the given datasets.
**Visualization:** Visual representations were created to aid in interpreting the data, including histograms, density plots, and box plots.
**Interpretation**: Each analysis was followed by an interpretation of the results, providing insights into the underlying data patterns and trends.
**Documentation:** The solutions were documented clearly, providing explanations for the chosen methods and interpretations of the results.
